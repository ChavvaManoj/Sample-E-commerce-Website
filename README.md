# E-Commerce Website (React + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)
I developed a simple e-commerce web application using React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database. The app allows users to view products, search by keyword, and manage product details. I implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing product data. It also includes features like image upload, RESTful APIs, and data storage using JPA. This project helped me understand full-stack development, API integration, and connecting frontend and backend systems.
